# matheuristic_sscflp

Matheuristic algorithm code for Single Source Capacitated Location Problem

It was shown that the algorithm generates quality solutions for very large-scale SSCFLP instances

Instructions to run on a linux operating system:

1) CPLEX (any version) must be installed on the machine.

2) Copy the files "sscflp.cpp'' and "makefile" to a directory

3) In the "makefile" file check the CPLEX path

4) In a terminal go to the directory and use the "make" command to create the sscflp executable

5) To run on an "instance name" file use the command ./sscflp "instance name"
